# AWS Greengrass Core C SDK - README.md

## Overview

The AWS Greengrass Core SDK for C provides an interface to interact with the Greengrass Core system on the edge. It is c89 compliant and is meant to be performant while minimizing dependencies.

AWS Greengrass Core SDK for C is now in General Availability.

## Requirements
* libc 2.14+
* cmake 2.8+
* Greengrass Core 1.6+

## Building the SDK

Clone the SDK into local workspace:

```
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c.git
```

Build the SDK:

```
cd aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The build will produce a shared object named **libaws-greengrass-core-sdk-c.so** under the build/aws-greengras-core-sdk-c directory. This is the shared object that the Lambda executable links to.

**Note:**
  - The shared object is a stub implementation that helps Lambda executables to link against. It will be overridden by the actual shared object that comes with the Greengrass Core release bundle.
  - The `-Wl,--enable-new-dtags` flag is needed for adding the Greengrass C SDK shared object path into the Lambda executable's RUNPATH, so that the stub shared object can be overridden by the **libaws-greengrass-core-sdk-c.so** which comes along with the Greengrass Core Release bundle. It is automatically included when linking to aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c.

## Building Greengrass Native Lambda with CMake
You can use CMake to build Greengrass Lambda executables. Other build tools could work as well.
Here cmake is shown as an example:

### Setting up a CMake Project
Create a directory to hold your project:

```
mkdir my_gg_native_function
```

Open the directory and add a `CMakeLists.txt` file that specifies your project's name, executables, source files, and linked libraries. The following is a minimal example:

```
# minimal CMakeLists.txt for the AWS Greengrass SDK for C
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
# "my_gg_native_function" is just an example value.
project(my_gg_native_function)

# Locate the AWS Greengras SDK for C package.
# Requires that you build with:
#   -Daws-greengrass-core-sdk-c_DIR=/path/to/sdk_build
# or export/set:
#   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/sdk_build
find_package(aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_gg_native_funtion main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_gg_native_funtion aws-greengrass-core-sdk-c)
```

To get started quickly, there are several pre-made examples in the aws-greengras-core-sdk-c-example directory for your reference. Those examples are built along with the SDK.

## Creating Deployment Package
After the Lambda executable is built, it should be packaged into a deployment package, which is a zip file consisting of your executable and any dependencies. Then you can upload the package to AWS Lambda and deploy it to a device by following the normal AWS Greengrass process.

## Using the SDK
### Initialization
All code that uses the AWS Greengrass SDK for C must do **gg_global_init()** before calling any other APIs and **gg_runtime_start()** to start the runtime, as follows:
```
#include "greengrasssdk.h"

void handler(const gg_lambda_context *cxt) {
    /* Your lambda logic goes here. */
}

int main() {
    gg_global_init(0);
    /* start the runtime in blocking mode. This blocks forever. */
    gg_runtime_start(handler, 0);
}
```

### Reading Event Payload
To read event payload for the Lambda handler to process, use **gg_lambda_handler_read()**. The amount of data written into the buffer is not guaranteed to be complete until **amount_read** is zero.

The following is a sample usage of the method:

```
/* loop read handler event into buffer. */
gg_error loop_lambda_handler_read(void *buffer,
        size_t buffer_size, size_t *total_read) {
    gg_error err = GGE_SUCCESS;
    uint8_t *read_index = (uint8_t*)buffer;
    size_t remaining_buf_size = buffer_size;
    size_t amount_read = 0;

    do {
        err = gg_lambda_handler_read(read_index, remaining_buf_size,
                &amount_read);
        if(err) {
            gg_log(GG_LOG_ERROR, "gg_lambda_handler_read had an error");
            goto cleanup;
        }
        *total_read += amount_read;
        read_index += amount_read;
        remaining_buf_size -= amount_read;
    } while(amount_read);

cleanup:
    return err;
}
```
### Writing Handler Response
After the Lambda handler finishes processing, responses can be returned using **gg_lambda_handler_write_response()**. If this method is not called, an empty response will be returned.

### Writing Handler Error Response
When the Lambda handler encounters any error, the error response can be returned to the caller using **gg_lambda_handler_write_error()**.

### Initialize API Request
Every API request must be initialized using **gg_request_init()** before making the actual request.

### Reading API Response
There are several cases which require reading a response after an API call, such as **gg_invoke()**, **gg_get_thing_shadow()**, etc. **gg_request_read()** should be used after the method call to retrieve the output response.

The following is a sample usage of the method:

```
/* loop read request bytes into buffer. */
gg_error loop_request_read(gg_request ggreq, void *buffer,
        size_t buffer_size, size_t *total_read) {
    gg_error err = GGE_SUCCESS;
    uint8_t *read_index = (uint8_t*)buffer;
    size_t remaining_buf_size = buffer_size;
    size_t amount_read = 0;

    do {
        err = gg_request_read(ggreq, read_index, remaining_buf_size,
                &amount_read);
        if(err) {
            gg_log(GG_LOG_ERROR, "gg_lambda_handler_read had an error");
            goto cleanup;
        }
        *total_read += amount_read;
        read_index += amount_read;
        remaining_buf_size -= amount_read;
    } while(amount_read);

cleanup:
    return err;
}
```

### Error Handling
When there is an error on method call, all the APIs have **gg_error** returned as the return code. And for **gg_publish()**, **gg_invoke()** and **gg_xxx_thing_shadow()** APIs, you can check for server side errors from request status from the **gg_request_result()** struct.
